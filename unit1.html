Describe the Joint Stock Principle?
Some Colonies were settled by a joint-stock company, a form of business organization. The company received a charter from the English Crown granting it a monopoly over trade and colonization for a period of years within a specific area. In return, the company was to give the Crown a share of the profits earned and precious metals such as gold or silver that it acquired. Although the primary function of the joint-stock company was economic, the charter also gave it the authority to govern its territory. Consequently, in their early days as colonies, both Virginia and Massachusetts were governed by the company that founded them.

English law says it doesn't matter if it's true or not but Jury acquits Zenger anyway.
Not total freedom of the press, but newspapers now took greater risks in criticism of public figures.
Zenger decision was a landmark case which paved the way for the eventual freedom of the press.

All goods imported to the colonies (with the exception of some perishables) had to pass through England’s ports.
Specified / enumerated goods from the colonies were to be exported to England only. (Tobacco was the original enumerated good but as time passed, the list expanded).
Help pay for the thousands of British troops still in North America
British citizens taxed 5 times more than colonists - breaking point 

What was the Impact of the Navigational acts on the Colonies?
+: Caused New England shipbuilding to prosper, provided Chesapeake tobacco with a monopoly in England, and provided English military forces to protect the colonies from potential attacks by the French and Spanish.
- : The acts severely limited development of colonial manufacturing, forced chesapeake farmers to accept low prices for their crops, and caused colonists to pay high prices for manufactured goods from England.
Mercantilist regulations were unnecessary, since England would have been the colonies’ primary trading partner in any case. The economic advantages from the Navigation acts were offset by their negative political effects on British colonial relations → colonists resented regulatory laws imposed by the distant government in London. In new england, colonists defied the acts by smuggling in other countries’ goods. 

How did Britain enforce the Navigational Acts?
British government was often lax in enforcing the acts, and its agents in the colonies were known for corruption. However, the crown would attempt to overcome colonial resistance to its trade laws.

Describe the Dominion of New England?
1685: James II (a new king) succeeded to the throne. He was determined to increase royal control over the colonies by combining them into larger administrative units and getting rid of their representative assemblies.

The french explored further inland: along the St. Lawrence River, the great lakes, and the Mississippi River.
The french claimed a region from the Appalachian mountains to the Rocky mountains but conflict arose because the English claimed part of this (the Ohio River valley) as well. 

What are the different reasons that the English and the French want to control the Ohio River Valley?
